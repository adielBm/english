## General formal properties of modal verbs

- Modal verbs have only one form and do not inflect for person or number.
- Modal verbs do not have infinitive forms, either with *to* or without. 
- Modal verbs have no *-ing* form and no *-ed* participle form and therefore lack progressive and perfect forms
- Modal verbs are placed first in the verb phrase and are followed by a verb in the base form. The next verb may be a lexical verb or an auxiliary verb (be, do, have) or the substitute verb do, but cannot be another modal verb.
- Modal verbs cannot be used as lexical verbs. (*~~I must to bed~~*)
- Modal verbs can only stand alone when the lexical verb is understood. (*A: He might have a phone. B: Yes, he might.*)

## Comparison between *can*, *could* and *may*

### Permission

**Could** is usually heard as more formal and polite than can, and **may** is the most formal/polite of the three.

### Probabilities

**Can** refers to what the speaker believes to be a factor to be usually the case. **Could** and **may** refer to possible events.
**Could** and **may** rather than **can** are used to speculate about whether something is true or possible.

## Comparison between *could*, *may* and *might*

### Probability

Could, may and might are all used to express degrees of certainty. May expresses a slightly greater degree of certainty than could, and tends to be used in more formal contexts. Might is more tentative than may or could.

## Shall
Shall has two main meanings; one refers to future intentions, the other is concerned with offers and advice.

#### Future intentions

- _Shall_ is used instead of _will_ with first person subjects in rather formal contexts to make predictions and to announce intentions or decisions. It is much less frequent than _will_
- _Shall not/shan’t_ is very rarer, but does occur in formal contexts to make predictions and announce intentions or decisions

#### Making offers and seeking advice

Shall in first person interrogatives is much more frequent than other uses of shall and is common in the making of offers and suggestions, and in seeking advice: _Shall we go and have a walk in the garden?_

#### Directives
Shall is also used to issue directives but this use is very formal and rare: _(notice in an aircraft cabin) This curtain shall be left open during takeoff and landing._

# Semi modals

*Semi-modals* can behave grammatically either like lexical verbs or like core modal verbs.

- need
- dare 
- ought to
- used to

### used to

- The negative of *used to* is most typically *didn’t use(d) to* (_I didn’t used to like jazz_). In more formal styles, *used not to* occurs (_I used not to like jazz_). The contracted form *usedn’t to* may occasionally occur, but is very rare
- The interrogative of used to has two forms; the more common form is with auxiliary did. (_Did you used to like jazz_) The alternative form involves subject-verb inversion (*Used you to like jazz*), and is very rare
- Emphatic did may occur with used to. The construction may be represented in writing as did used to or did use to

### ought to

- Interrogative form (***Ought** we **to** call the police?*)
- Negative form (*I **ought not to** go)
- Question tags (*This picture **ought to** be hung somewhere, **oughtn’t** it?*)
- Interrogatives, negatives and question tags with *ought to* are very rare; should is generally preferred instead (*This picture **ought to** be hung somewhere, **shouldn’t** it?*)
