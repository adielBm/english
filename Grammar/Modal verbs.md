## General formal properties of modal verbs

- Modal verbs have only one form and do not inflect for person or number.
- Modal verbs do not have infinitive forms, either with *to* or without. 
- Modal verbs have no *-ing* form and no *-ed* participle form and therefore lack progressive and perfect forms
- Modal verbs are placed first in the verb phrase and are followed by a verb in the base form. The next verb may be a lexical verb or an auxiliary verb (be, do, have) or the substitute verb do, but cannot be another modal verb.
- Modal verbs cannot be used as lexical verbs. (*~~I must to bed~~*)
- Modal verbs can only stand alone when the lexical verb is understood. (*A: He might have a phone. B: Yes, he might.*)


# Semi modals

- ought to 

- had better
- *be* - *You **are** not to tell anyone*

## have to
-  subject **have to** verb

>The interrogative and negative of have to are formed most commonly with **auxiliary *do*** or, less commonly, in formal contexts, by subject-verb inversion.

>***have got to*** is the same like ***have to***, but the interrogative and negative of that are formed by subject-verb inversion.

## had better
- subject **had better (not)** verb
- **had** subject **better** verb
- **had not** subject **better** verb

>The same for ***had best***

## Comparison between *can*, *could* and *may*

### Permission

**Could** is usually heard as more formal and polite than can, and **may** is the most formal/polite of the three.

### Probabilities

**Can** refers to what the speaker believes to be a factor to be usually the case. **Could** and **may** refer to possible events.
**Could** and **may** rather than **can** are used to speculate about whether something is true or possible.
