*Semi-modals* can behave grammatically either like lexical verbs or like core modal verbs.

- need 
- dare 
- ought to
- used to

### used to

- The negative of *used to* is most typically *didn’t use(d) to* (_I didn’t used to like jazz_). In more formal styles, *used not to* occurs (_I used not to like jazz_). The contracted form *usedn’t to* may occasionally occur, but is very rare
- The interrogative of used to has two forms; the more common form is with auxiliary did. (_Did you used to like jazz_) The alternative form involves subject-verb inversion (*Used you to like jazz*), and is very rare
- Emphatic did may occur with used to. The construction may be represented in writing as did used to or did use to

### ought to

- Interrogative form (***Ought** we **to** call the police?*)
- Negative form (*I **ought not to** go)
- Question tags (*This picture **ought to** be hung somewhere, **oughtn’t** it?*)
- Interrogatives, negatives and question tags with *ought to* are very rare; should is generally preferred instead (*This picture **ought to** be hung somewhere, **shouldn’t** it?*)
