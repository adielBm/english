## General formal properties of modal verbs

- Modal verbs have only one form and do not inflect for person or number.
- Modal verbs do not have infinitive forms, either with *to* or without. 
- Modal verbs have no *-ing* form and no *-ed* participle form and therefore lack progressive and perfect forms
- Modal verbs are placed first in the verb phrase and are followed by a verb in the base form. The next verb may be a lexical verb or an auxiliary verb (be, do, have) or the substitute verb do, but cannot be another modal verb.
- Modal verbs cannot be used as lexical verbs. (*~~I must to bed~~*)
- Modal verbs can only stand alone when the lexical verb is understood. (*A: He might have a phone. B: Yes, he might.*)

## shall
Shall has two main meanings; one refers to future intentions, the other is concerned with offers and advice.

#### #future intentions

- _Shall_ is used instead of _will_ with first person subjects in rather formal contexts to make predictions and to announce intentions or decisions. It is much less frequent than _will_
- _Shall not/shan’t_ is very rarer, but does occur in formal contexts to make predictions and announce intentions or decisions

#### Making offers and seeking advice

Shall in first person interrogatives is much more frequent than other uses of shall and is common in the making of offers and suggestions, and in seeking advice: _Shall we go and have a walk in the garden?_

#### #directives

Shall is also used to issue directives but this use is very formal and rare: _(notice in an aircraft cabin) This curtain shall be left open during takeoff and landing._

## should

- #desirable #ideal #duty #propriety #expediency #obligation 
	- He should have been here at five and he’s not here yet.
	- She should be wearing glasses.

In AmE, the present #subjunctive is commonly used instead of should (e.g., "suggest that he stay"), while in BrE, should is commoner (e.g., "suggest that he should stay").

## must 
#todo

## Comparisons

### *can*, *could* and *may*

##### #permission

**Could** is usually heard as more formal and polite than can, and **may** is the most formal/polite of the three.

##### #probability 

**Can** refers to what the speaker believes to be a factor to be usually the case. **Could** and **may** refer to possible events.
**Could** and **may** rather than **can** are used to speculate about whether something is true or possible.

### *could*, *may* and *might*

##### #probability

Could, may and might are all used to express degrees of certainty. May expresses a slightly greater degree of certainty than could, and tends to be used in more formal contexts. Might is more tentative than may or could.
