- the ***preposition*** goes at the end of the question - *Who did you send these pictures **to**?**
- the ***adverb*** goes at the end of the question - *where are you living **now**?
- `[AUX]` is **do**, **be**, **have**, or **modal verb** 
- `[SQ] = [AUX] [Subject] [Verb] (prepostion) (adverb)` - Yes/no question (with prepostion)

# *what*, *which* 

### pronoun

- Affirmative: *You want to talk today about trips*
- Interrogatives:  `what [SQ]` 
   - *What do you want to talk about today?*
   - What does it cost?
   - What is your name?

> in *which*, it can be with PP ('of those houses') 
> *Which **of those houses** do you live in*

### determiner

like *which*, especially which of an open-ended set of possibilities.

- Affirmative: `[subject] [verb] [object-type]` *The lion eats meat*
- Interrogatives: `what [object] [SQ]` - *What food does the lion eat?*
	- What time is it?
	- What color are you going to use?

>In cases where both "what" and "which" are possible, with similar meaning, "what" is preferred for open-ended choices, while "which" is preferred for choices from a closed group or set. For example, "Which one of these do you want?" not "What one of these do you want?".

### *what* as adverb
In what way; to what extent.

- _**What** does it matter?_
- _**What** do you care?_


## *who* and *whom*

### pronoun

- Affirmative: *Daniel saw Joe.* 
	- pronoun of ***subject***: 
		- ***Who** saw Joe?* (who = subject = 'Daniel') - `who [verb] [object]`
		- *I don't know **who saw Joe**.* (indirect question)
	- pronoun of ***direct object***: 
		- ***Whom** did Daniel see?* (whom = direct object = 'Joe') `whom [aux] [subject] [verb]`
		- *I don't know **whom Daniel sees**.* (indirect question)
- Affirmative: Robin gave candy to the child. 
	- pronoun of ***subject***: ('robin')
		- ***Who** gave candy to the child?* 
	- pronoun of ***indirect object*** ('child') 
		- To whom did Robin give candy? (formal)
		- Who did Robin give candy to?
- Affirmative: *You speak to Bob*
	- pronoun of ***direct object*** ('Bob') after *TO* 
		- To whom did you speak? (formal)
		- Who did you speak to? (informal)

Usage notes
- ***To/With whom...*** (formal) and ***Who ... to/with*** (informal) are used where in the affirmative there is ***(verb) to/with (someone)***.
	-  **With whom** did you go? (formal). **Who** did you go **with**? (informal)
	-  **To whom** did you give it? (formal). **Who** did you give it **to**? (informal)
- **whoever/whomever/whosever** used as an emphatic form (expressing disbelief) of **who/whom/whose**. 
	- ***Whoever** thought up that stupid idea?*
- ***Who*** can also be used as an object pronoun instead ***whom***, especially in informal writing and speech, and *whom* may be seen as (overly) formal.

#### *whose* 
- possessive from of who
	- determiner: 
		- Whose bike is that? (That is Daniel's bike)
		- Whose house is this? (This is his house)
		- That's a nice coat - I wonder whose it is? (That is Bob's coat)
