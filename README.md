Hi, I have a few thoughts.

> Typically, in a closed stressed syllable, the letter 'O' represents the /ɔ/ sound,* as in dog.

I think that typically in a closed stressed syllable it will be /ɑ/, as like in (shop, sock, lock, stock, pot, bot, got, cot, tot, dot, thot, sot, jot, hot, lot, not). but these words that I found are /ɔ/ in the letter 'O': 

- cloth, moth; 
- off; 
- dog, fog, bog, log; 
- loss, boss, moss, toss; cross;
- lost, cost, frost;
- wrong, strong, belong, throng, song, long, along;

I noticed that in the pie chart, the words 'job' and 'stop' are listed under both(!) /ɑ/ and /ɔ/ slices, even though they are pronounced as /ɑ/ according to Wiktionary and the Routledge Dictionary of Pronunciation and more. (even for non 'cot–caught merger').

Additionally, many dictionaries indicate that 'wander' is pronounced as /ɑ/, (as in Wiktionary, Routledge, cambridge, merriam-webster, oxfordlearnersdictionaries) instead of /ɔ/. 

In another article (about "mower" and "mover"), you said: 

> 'O' is pronounced as the /ɔ/ or /ɑ/ sounds in closed stressed syllables, like in 'got' or boss.

However, I couldn't find any dictionary that states 'GOT' as having the /ɔ/ sound.

Thank you. I must say that I learn a lot from this website. I would greatly appreciate a response to my comments. Many thanks.
