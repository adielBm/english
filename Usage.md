## Present Simple 

- **habits / routines** - *I always **brush** my teeth before bed*
- **facts** - *The sun **rises** in the East*
- **quoting someone** ^[even if the words were spoken in the past] - *Mary **says** she's ready*
- **arranged future event** - *The train **arrives** at 10pm tonight*
- **condition** - *We will report as soon as we **receive** any information*
- **zero conditional** - *Ice **melts** if you heat it*

## Present Progressive

- **temporary situations** - *It's raining in San Francisco rigth now*
- **temporary activity** - *I am writing a book this month*
- **pre-arranged future event** - *He is playing golf tomorrow* 
- **Emphasize frequency** ^[of an action in a humorous or hyperbolic way] - *He is always eating chocolate!*

## Present Perfect 
- An ongoing action that **started in the past**, but has a **result in the present** - *They **have played** piano since the age of three*
  
	Note that you can also use the present perfect continuous tense for this situation, as long as the action has not been completed yet (and it’s not a stative verb). The difference between the present perfect tense and the present perfect continuous tense, in this case, is emphasis: 
	- The *present perfect* tense emphasizes the **effects** or **consequences** of the action. 
	- The *present perfect continuous* tense emphasizes the **action itself** or the **length of time**.
  
- **Unspecified time in the past** - *I **have visited** Paris many times*
- An action that was completed very recently (just, now) - *Look! **I have cooked** dinner for us, It's ready now*
- A change over time - *My cousin **has grown** so much since I saw her two years ago*
- An uncompleted action that is expected to be finished (in the negative) - *I **haven’t finished** my paper, but it’s due in an hour!*
- To add significance to a completed action - *I **have met** the love of my life!*
